The purpose of this model is to translate sign language using a transformer 
(whose data are calculated by the SAMSUNG Galaxy Watch, SAMSUNG Smart Ring, and sEMG electrode).

First, this code is quoted from Camgoz's "Sign Language Transformers: Joint End-to-end Sign Language Recognition and Translation". 

After our team has completed the algorithm, we will enhance the model.
